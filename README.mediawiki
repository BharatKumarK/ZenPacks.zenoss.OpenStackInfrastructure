__TOC__

This ZenPack allows for monitoring of OpenStack from a service provider
perspective.  This means that in addition to the user-oriented components
supported in the regular OpenStack ZenPack (instances, flavors, images), the
underlying OpenStack servers and software are monitored.

=== Features ===

* Monitors Overall OpenStack state
* Monitors Nova and Neutron health
* Monitors multiple Tenant Infrastructure
* Monitors Nova Services and components
* Models and monitors Neutron Services and components
* Impact and Root-Cause (Requires Zenoss Service Dynamics)

== Prerequisites ==

* OpenStack (Icehouse or newer)
* Ceilometer-OpenStack compatible with your version of OpenStack
* ceilometer_zenoss 1.0.0+ (https://github.com/zenoss/ceilometer_zenoss)
** This Zenoss-specific plugin must be installed on your Ceilometer nodes (see below)
** If not installed and configured properly, Instances and vNICs graphs will be blank, and Zenoss will not detect changes (such as new instances or instance state changes) until a full model is performed.
* PyYAML needs to be installed in order to use the YAML configuration
** All 5.X versions of Zenoss have PyYAML already installed
** Only 4.2.4 SP763 or 4.2.5 SP378 or earlier affected
** You will have to add this Python package to your Zenoss installation otherwise
** Update to the latest RPS or "easy_install pyyaml" manually if required.
* SSH credentials to the Linux devices in your OpenStack environment
** Configure the zCommandUsername/zCommandPassword properties on the /Devices/Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost device class.
** If your Linux devices are already managed under Zenoss, move them into /Devices/Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost
* Administrative credentials for your OpenStack environment
** Username, password, keystone URL, Region

== Basic Usage ==

===Device Setup via UI===

{{warning|Host Setup:}}
<blockquote style="
 background: #eca;
 border: solid thick gray;
 padding-top: 5px;
 padding-right: 10px;
 padding-bottom: 5px;
 padding-left: 10px;">
'''<u>We recommend against manually configuring Linux host devices!</u>'''

Linux Host device names must use the same FQDN hostname that Openstack ZenPack
is expecting. Choosing different device names will break this process.
'''Therefore it is STRONGLY recommended that you do not manually pre-configure'''
'''those Linux devices, but rather allow the OpenStack ZenPack to automatically'''
'''discover and configure those devices at model time.'''

If this is not possible, you will have to re-name and re-configure those hosts
and place them into the /Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost device class manually, which
is very labor intensive.
</blockquote>

Once the OpenStack ZenPack is installed and you can begin monitoring by going
to the infrastructure screen and clicking the normal button for adding devices.
You'll find a new option labeled, "Add OpenStack Endpoint (Infrastructure)."

Choose that option and you'll be presented with a dialog asking for the following inputs.

# Device To Create - non-empty, non-ip, non-dns, unique name to use for this device in Zenoss. ''See note below''.
# Auth URL - A keystone URL, such as http://<hostname>:5000/v2.0/
# Username, Password/API Key, Project/Tenant ID - *Administrative* credentials to your Zenoss instance.
# Region Name - choose the correct region from the drop-down.  You may only choose one, so each region you wish to manage must be registered as a separate endpoint in Zenoss.
# Ceilometer URL - Will auto-populate based on the other selections.

Once you click Add, Zenoss will contact the OpenStack API and discover servers,
images and flavors. Once it is complete you'll find a new device in the
OpenStack device class with the same name as the hostname or IP you entered
into the dialog. Click into this new device to see everything that was
discovered.

{{note|'''Device Name'''}}
The '''Device name''' should be a non-empty, non-hostname, non-IP,
since that name will be used when the host is registered as a Linux device. The
name should be unique within the Zenoss environment. This is especially
important if you are adding another device that share the same IP address or
hostname that already exist on another device. Not doing this may result in
devices with the same name conflicting with each other. (e.g. attempting to
model device would show modeling results that belong to another device OR
device would show relations that do not belong to that device)

===Device Setup via Zenbatchload===

You can setup the device using *zenbatchload* as follows:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">zenbatchload <filename></syntaxhighlight>

where ''<filename>'' should have the form:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
/Devices/OpenStack/Infrastructure loader='openstackinfrastructure', loader_arg_keys=['deviceName', 'username', 'api_key', 'project_id', 'auth_url', 'ceilometer_url', 'region_name', 'collector']
   <devicename> username='<username>', api_key='<password>', project_id='<tenant ID>', auth_url='http://<ip address>:5000/v2.0/', region_name='RegionOne'</syntaxhighlight>

* As before zCommandUsername/zCommandPassword properties must be set manually for /Devices/Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost device class.

===Organizational Elements===

Zenoss Event Console.

==Host Based Installation vs Container Based Installation==

This zenpack supports both host based installation and container based
installation.

===Host Based Installation===

With host based installation, the OpenStack binaries are directly installed on
the host. For instance,  the binary nova-api would be installed directly in the
controller host's /usr/bin directory. In this case, leave the zProperties
zOpenStackRunNovaManageInContainer, zOpenStackRunVirshQemuInContainer, and
zOpenStackRunNeutronCommonInContainer unset in zenpack.yaml:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
      zOpenStackRunNovaManageInContainer:
      zOpenStackRunVirshQemuInContainer:
      zOpenStackRunNeutronCommonInContainer:
</syntaxhighlight>

===Container Based Installation===

With container based installation, each OpenStack binary runs inside its own
container. In this case, set the zProperties zOpenStackRunNovaManageInContainer,
zOpenStackRunVirshQemuInContainer, and zOpenStackRunNeutronCommonInContainer in
zenpack.yaml as:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
      zOpenStackRunNovaManageInContainer: novaconduct
      zOpenStackRunVirshQemuInContainer: novacompute
      zOpenStackRunNeutronCommonInContainer: neutron_server
</syntaxhighlight>

==Ceilometer Enablement==

Although you may add an OpenStack device to Zenoss, as shown above, event and
performance data will not be collected until the following steps are performed.

===Zenoss Configuration Steps===

On the Zenoss host in Zenoss 4.X, or RabbitMQ container in Zenoss 5.X:

* ssh in as the Zenoss user:
* export ZPDIR=$ZENHOME/ZenPacks/ZenPacks.zenoss.OpenStackInfrastructure*
* Now execute:

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
   $ZPDIR/ZenPacks/zenoss/OpenStackInfrastructure/bin/openstack_amqp_config
</syntaxhighlight>

This script will create a new user in RabbitMQ and set up its permissions.  It
will print out the proper values to use for amqp_hostname, amqp_port,
amqp_userid, amqp_password, and amqp_virtualhost during ceilometer
configuration (see below)

===OpenStack Ceilometer Configuration Steps===

Zenoss relies upon a Ceilometer dispatcher plugin to ship raw event and
metering data from Ceilometer to Zenoss for storage in the Zenoss event
and performance databases.   This integration is done by publishing messages
to Zenoss's RabbitMQ server.

This dispatcher should be installed on all nodes running any ceilometer, but
particularly those running ceilometer-collector or ceilometer-agent-notification.

To install it, perform the following steps on each of these OpenStack nodes (NOT
on the Zenoss collector):

<syntaxhighlight lang="bash">
  sudo pip -q install --force-reinstall https://github.com/zenoss/ceilometer_zenoss/archive/master.zip
  sudo cp /usr/lib/*/site-packages/ceilometer_zenoss/event_definitions.yaml /etc/ceilometer/
</syntaxhighlight>

Edit /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf, and add the following lines to the
appropriate sections:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
  [DEFAULT]
  dispatcher=zenoss

  [notification]
  store_events=True
</syntaxhighlight>

Also add the [dispatcher_zenoss] section reported by openstack_amqp_config above.

{{note}} Please restart all Ceilometer services on all hosts after making these changes.

===Optional Steps===

====VM State Changes====

By default, instance state changes will be captured by Zenoss when certain
events occur, for example, when an instance is shut down, the state change
to SHUTDOWN will be reflected in Zenoss.

However, certain state changes that don't correspond to another defined event
may not be picked up until the next time Zenoss models the environment.

If you would like to reduce the likelihood of this occurring, you can configure
OpenStack Nova to send an event (through ceilometer) to Zenoss whenever
any VM state change occurs by adding the following to nova.conf:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
  [DEFAULT]
  notify_on_state_change=vm_state
</syntaxhighlight>

Note that this will cause increased event load, both on OpenStack and Zenoss,
and additional processing within the event transforms in Zenoss to keep
the model consistent.   Since most instance changes will still be caught
without this option enabled, it is recommended to leave this disabled if your
OpenStack environment is very large.

====Increasing Polling Interval====

Zenoss will process performance datapoints from Ceilometer every 10 minutes,
since by default, Ceilometer will only produce one datapoint every 10 minutes.
This can be adjusted by modifying the "interval: 600" line in your
pipeline.yaml file (typically /etc/ceilometer/pipeline.yaml).

== Zenoss Analytics ==

This ZenPack provides additional support for Zenoss Analytics. Perform the
following steps to install extra reporting resources into Zenoss Analytics
after installing the ZenPack.

# Copy analytics-bundle.zip from $ZENHOME/ZenPacks/ZenPacks.zenoss.OpenStackInfrastructure*/ZenPacks/zenoss/OpenStackInfrastructure/analytics/ on your Zenoss server.
# Navigate to Zenoss Analytics in your browser.
# Login as superuser.
# Remove any existing ''OpenStackInfrastructure ZenPack'' folder.
## Choose ''Repository'' from the ''View'' menu at the top of the page.
## Expand ''Public'' in the list of folders.
## Right-click on ''OpenStackInfrastructure ZenPack'' folder and choose ''Delete''.
## Confirm deletion by clicking ''OK''.
# Add the new ''OpenStackInfrastructure ZenPack'' folder.
## Choose ''Server Settings'' from the ''Manage' menu at the top of the page.
## Choose ''Import'' in the left page.
## Remove checks from all check boxes.
## Click ''Choose File'' to import a data file.
## Choose the analytics-bundle.zip file copied from your Zenoss server.
## Click ''Import''.

You can now navigate back to the ''OpenStackInfrastructure ZenPack'' folder in the repository to see the following resources added by the bundle.

;Domains
* OpenStackInfrastructure Domain

;Ad Hoc Views
* OpenStack Instance List

Domains can be used to create ad hoc views using the following steps.

# Choose ''Ad Hoc View'' from the ''Create'' menu.
# Click ''Domains'' at the top of the data chooser dialog.
# Expand ''Public'' then ''OpenStackInfrastructure ZenPack''.
# Choose the ''OpenStackInfrastructure Domain'' domain


== Service Impact and Root Cause Analysis ==

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds
built-in service impact and root cause analysis capabilities for OpenStack
infrastructure and instances. The service impact relationships shown in the
diagram and described below are automatically added. These will be included in
any services that contain one or more of the explicitly mentioned components.

[[File:impact.png|thumb|320px|Impact Relationship Diagram]]

===Recommended Impact Setup===

Since most components will be related to Tenants and Region we recommend:

* Navigate to Services (Impact)
* Add a Dynamic Service to your Services tab
* Add all Tenants to the Dynamic Service
* Add all Regions to the Dynamic Service

===Impact Relations===

Component failures will affect Impact as follows:

;Internal Impact Relationships
* OpenStack API endpoint impacts all Hosts
* Availabilty zone impacts associated Region
* Host impacts associated Hypervisors, Nova Services, Cells, Nova Apis, and Neutron Agents
* Hypervisor impacts the resident Instances (VMs)
* Nova Service affects the Availability Zone or Region that it supports
* Instance impacts the associated Tenant
* vNIC impacts the related Instance.
* Port impacts associated Instance
* Subnet impacts associated Ports and Tenants
* Floating-IP impacts associated Port
* Network impacts associated Subnets and Tenants
* Router impacts associated Subnets and Floating-ips
* Neutron Agent impacts associated Networks, Subnets and Routers

;External Impact Relationships
* Instance impacts guest operating system device.
* Cisco UCS vNIC impacts related host's underlying Linux device NIC.
* Cisco UCS service profile impacts host's underlying Linux device.
* Host impacted by associated Linux device.
* OS Processes on an underlying Linux device impact corresponding Nova APIs and  Nova Services on Host.

== ML2 Integration ==

Provides linkage between OpenStackInfrastrcuture components and relevant integrated device components; imports performance graphs from relevant integrated device components; provides impact graph relations between OpenStackInfrastrcuture components and relevant integrated device components

* OpenvSwitch Integration via OpenvSwitch ZenPack
* APIC Integration via Cisco APIC ZenPack
* NSX Integration via NSX ZenPack

== Known Issues ==

# [https://jira.zenoss.com/browse/ZEN-14585 ZEN-14585]: The same endpoint can not be monitored both as user and an infrastructure endpoints.
## Workaround: If you have been previously monitoring the endpoint as a User endpoint, delete the device before you re-add it as an Infrastructure endpoint.
# [https://jira.zenoss.com/browse/ZEN-14491 ZEN-14491]: A stack-trace may occur during the initial modeling of the device
## The trace will contain the error "ValueError: expected txn status 'Active' or 'Doomed', but it's 'Committed'"
## Workaround: Disregard the error.  You may also manually model the device to confirm that no further errors are reported.
# [https://jira.zenoss.com/browse/ZEN-17905 ZEN-17905]: Nova APIs component: Grey icons for Enabled and State after model/monitor.
## OpenStack nova service API does not provide information about Nova-API, so its status is, in fact, unknown.
# [https://jira.zenoss.com/browse/ZEN-19286]: If an OpenStackInfrastructure host device is created on or moved to the /Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost class and the device name is different from the host FQDN, then the linkage between OpenStackInfrastructure device and the OpenStackInfrastructure host may not be constructed correctly.
## Workaround: Do not create the /Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost device separately. Just create OpenStackInfrastructure device, and it will automatically create the OpenStackInfrastructure host devices under the /Server/SSH/Linux/NovaHost class.
